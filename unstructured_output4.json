1. Configuration and Model Registration Cluster:

Seed: ell\configurator.py::2 (Core configuration management functionality)
models\__init__.py::1 (Model registration imports and setup)
models\openai.py::2 (Function for registering OpenAI models to the configuration)
providers\__init__.py::1 (Collection of provider integrations)
ell\provider.py::3 (Abstract class for defining provider interfaces)

2. Language Model Program Definition Cluster:

Seed: lmp\complex.py::2 (Implementation of the complex decorator for LMPs)
lmp\simple.py::1 (The simple decorator for basic LMPs)
lmp\tool.py::2 (Decorator for defining tools within LMPs)
ell\types\message.py::1 (Defines foundational Message class)
ell\types\studio.py::4 (Data structures related to LMP storage and retrieval)

3. Real-time Interaction and Client Handling Cluster:

Seed: openai_realtime\client.py::1 (RealtimeClient class for OpenAI real-time interactions)
openai_realtime\api.py::2 (Handling the connection setup to the OpenAI real-time API)
