      "[{'content': 'The transition between Cluster 10 and Cluster 9 is centered around the initiation and execution of an evaluation workflow, which involves setting up evaluation parameters, managing the flow through different states, and generating reports based on the results. Here\\'s a detailed breakdown of how these clusters interact:\\n\\n### Cluster 10: Evaluation Initialization\\n\\n1. **Entry Point Functions**: Cluster 10 begins with several functions defined in `benchmark/claude_evaluation.py`, such as `evaluate_search()`, `evaluate_search_and_identify()`, and `evaluate_search_and_code()`. These functions serve as entry points for different types of evaluations. Each function configures a specific set of transition rules and parameters. For example, `evaluate_search()` sets up transitions for a search-focused evaluation.\\n\\n2. **Transition Rules Setup**: Within these functions, `TransitionRules` objects are created with specific `global_params` and `state_params`. These parameters define how the state transitions should occur and what initial conditions are required. For instance, the `evaluate_search()` function sets up a transition from `SearchCode` to `Finished` state based on certain triggers like \"did_search\".\\n\\n3. **Creating Evaluation Instances**: Each entry point function instantiates the `Evaluation` class, passing the configured transition rules along with other parameters such as `evaluations_dir`, `evaluation_name`, and `index_store_dir`. This process effectively sets the stage for the evaluation to be executed, preparing the necessary environment and configurations.\\n\\n### Cluster 9: Evaluation Execution and Management\\n\\n1. **Evaluation Class**: The `Evaluation` class in `benchmark/evaluation.py` (Cluster 9) is responsible for executing the evaluation process. It manages directories for storing trajectories and logs, handles transitions, and records results. The class is initialized with the parameters provided by the functions in Cluster 10.\\n\\n2. **_evaluate_instance Method**: A key method in the `Evaluation` class is `_evaluate_instance`, which conducts the evaluation for a single instance. It sets up the workspace using the `Workspace.from_dirs` method and creates an `AgenticLoop` to manage the state transitions during the evaluation. The `AgenticLoop` is initialized with the transition rules defined in Cluster 10.\\n\\n3. **AgenticLoop**: The `AgenticLoop` class in `moatless/loop.py` manages the execution flow and state transitions. It processes states according to the transition rules, executing actions and persisting state changes in a `Trajectory` object. This allows for a structured evaluation process where each state transition is logged and can be reviewed.\\n\\n4. **Trajectory Management**: The `Trajectory` class in `moatless/trajectory.py` records the sequence of states and actions undertaken during an evaluation. This includes storing metadata and results, which are ultimately used to generate reports.\\n\\n5. **Report Generation**: Upon completion of the evaluation, the `generate_md_report` function in `benchmark/report_v2.py` creates a markdown report summarizing the evaluation results, including any errors encountered and the predicted code changes. This function accesses the trajectory data to compile a detailed account of the evaluation process, leveraging the metadata and results captured by the `Trajectory`.\\n\\n### Interaction and Flow\\n\\n- **Parameter Passing**: The transition from Cluster 10 to Cluster 9 involves passing evaluation parameters and transition rules to the `Evaluation` class from the entry point functions. This ensures that the evaluation environment is configured correctly according to the defined parameters.\\n\\n- **State Management**: The `AgenticLoop` from Cluster 9 executes the state transitions based on the rules set in Cluster 10. This loop handles the logic of moving through various states like `SearchCode`, `IdentifyCode`, `DecideRelevance`, and `PlanToCode`, as specified by the transition rules.\\n\\n- **Logging and Reporting**: The trajectory and metadata captured during the evaluation are used to generate detailed reports. These reports provide insights into the evaluation\\'s performance and outcomes, fulfilling the objectives set during the initialization phase in Cluster 10.\\n\\nIn summary, the transition is a seamless flow from the setup of evaluation parameters in Cluster 10 to the execution and management of the evaluation process in Cluster 9, culminating in the generation of comprehensive reports.', 'nextWiki': 'Automated Code Evaluation and Workflow Management'}, {'content': 'The transition between Cluster 9 and Cluster 97236 represents a critical interaction within the codebase, where an automated evaluation framework (Cluster 9) leverages a state management and transition system (Cluster 97236) to process code evaluation workflows. \\n\\n### Cluster 9: Source of Transition\\n\\nIn Cluster 9, the `Evaluation` class is central to managing the evaluation process of code instances. This class is responsible for setting up and executing workflows that evaluate code changes. A key method within this class, `_evaluate_instance()`, orchestrates the workflow by leveraging the `AgenticLoop` class from Cluster 97236.\\n\\n#### Key Components:\\n- **`Evaluation._evaluate_instance()`**: This method sets up the necessary environment and parameters for evaluating a code instance. It initializes an `AgenticLoop` object, which is responsible for managing the state transitions during the evaluation process.\\n- **`AgenticLoop` Initialization**: Within `_evaluate_instance()`, an `AgenticLoop` is instantiated with various parameters, including `transition_rules`, `workspace`, `metadata`, and other configurations crucial for managing state transitions effectively.\\n\\n### Cluster 97236: Transition Management\\n\\nCluster 97236 contains the `AgenticLoop` class, which plays a pivotal role in executing and managing state transitions. This class is structured to handle complex workflows by iteratively executing states and transitioning between them based on defined rules and conditions.\\n\\n#### Key Components:\\n- **`AgenticLoop`**: This class manages the execution flow of the evaluation process. It uses `transition_rules` to define possible state transitions and the conditions under which they occur. The loop continues to execute states until a terminal state, such as `Finished` or `Rejected`, is reached.\\n- **State Transition Management**: The `AgenticLoop` class provides methods like `_execute_state_until_transition()` and `_execute_state()` to process actions within each state and handle transitions. It ensures that transitions adhere to defined rules and constraints, such as maximum costs or retries.\\n\\n### Interaction Between Clusters\\n\\n1. **Initialization**: The `Evaluation` class from Cluster 9 initializes an `AgenticLoop` object by passing necessary parameters, including `transition_rules` and `workspace`.\\n   \\n2. **Execution Flow**: The `AgenticLoop` in Cluster 97236 executes the workflow by managing state transitions. It processes each state using methods like `_execute_state()`, which handles actions and determines if a transition should occur based on the state’s response.\\n\\n3. **State Management**: Within the loop, various states are executed in a sequence determined by the `transition_rules`. The states, such as `ClarifyCodeChange`, `EditCode`, and `PlanToCode`, are defined in Cluster 97236 and encompass logic specific to each stage of the code evaluation process.\\n\\n4. **Loop Completion**: The loop continues until a terminal state is reached, at which point the evaluation process concludes, and the results are returned to the `Evaluation` class in Cluster 9.\\n\\nThis transition demonstrates a robust integration where Cluster 9 sets the stage for executing a workflow, and Cluster 97236 provides the mechanisms to manage the dynamic state transitions required to evaluate and process code changes effectively.', 'nextWiki': 'Automated Code State Management and Transition System'}, {'content': 'The transition between cluster 97236 and cluster 13 involves a systematic interaction where the `AgenticLoop` orchestrates state transitions, and the `SearchCode` state within this loop interacts with the `CodeIndex` class to perform code searches.\\n\\n### Key Components and Interactions:\\n\\n1. **AgenticLoop (Cluster 97236)**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` class is responsible for managing the execution flow and state transitions within the system. It contains methods such as `run()`, `_execute_state_until_transition()`, and `_execute_state()`, which facilitate these transitions.\\n   - When the loop runs, it initializes the first state, processes actions, and checks for state transitions based on responses. The loop continues until it reaches a terminal state, either `Finished` or `Rejected`.\\n\\n2. **State Management and SearchCode State (Cluster 97236)**:\\n   - Within the `AgenticLoop`, the `SearchCode` state is a critical state that handles the initiation of a code search. This state is part of a sequence of states managed by the `AgenticLoop`.\\n   - The `SearchCode` state, as a subclass of `AgenticState`, uses its `handle_action()` method to process search-related actions.

The classes and functions in this cluster are more about the infrastructure that supports state transitions and less about specific application logic. Key components include:\\n\\n- **AgenticState**: This is the base class for all states, including those in cluster 77036. It defines a structure for handling actions (`handle_action`), storing a history of actions (`_actions`), and managing execution status (`_executed`). It also provides properties and methods for interacting with the workspace and managing the lifecycle of a state.\\n\\n- **NoopState, Finished, Rejected, Pending**: These are utility states that represent terminal or initial conditions in the state machine. For example, `Finished` and `Rejected` are end states indicating successful completion or failure, respectively.\\n\\n- **Trajectory and TrajectoryState**: These classes manage the history of state transitions, capturing snapshots of the state and enabling the recovery or replay of actions.\\n\\n- **TransitionRule and TransitionRules**: These define the conditions under which states transition from one to another. Transition rules encapsulate triggers and the source and destination states, while transition rule sets (`TransitionRules`) manage collections of these rules and facilitate finding the next applicable rule.\\n\\n### Interaction and Transition\\n\\nThe interaction between these clusters occurs as specific state classes, like `DecideRelevance`, utilize the framework provided by cluster 31509 to execute their logic and manage transitions. Here’s how they interact:\\n\\n1. **State Execution**: In `DecideRelevance`, the `_execute_action` method is responsible for determining the next action based on the completion and relevance of the current action. This method returns an `ActionResponse` that indicates the trigger for the next transition.\\n\\n2. **State Transition**: The `ActionResponse.transition` method in `DecideRelevance` signals a transition by specifying a trigger (e.g., \"finish\" or \"search\"). This trigger is used by the `TransitionRules` in cluster 31509 to determine the next state.\\n\\n3. **Handling Actions**: The `AgenticState` class in cluster 31509 defines `handle_action`, which processes actions, updates the state’s action history, and determines if a transition should occur. The `DecideRelevance` state utilizes this method to manage its transition logic.\\n\\n4. **Transition Management**: The `TransitionRules` class in cluster 31509 contains logic to find and apply the appropriate transition rule based on the current state and the trigger provided by the action response. This mechanism ensures that each state transition adheres to predefined rules and conditions.\\n\\nIn summary, cluster 77036 provides specialized state logic for tasks like deciding relevance and searching, while cluster 31509 offers the foundational framework for managing these states and their transitions within a larger automated code evaluation workflow.

This process begins in Cluster 10, specifically within the `benchmark/claude_evaluation.py` file, where various evaluation functions such as `evaluate_search()`, `evaluate_search_and_identify()`, and `evaluate_search_and_code()` are defined. These functions are responsible for setting up and triggering evaluations based on different scenarios.\\n\\n1. **Initiation of Evaluation**: \\n   - Each evaluation function in `benchmark/claude_evaluation.py` begins by defining a set of transition rules using the `TransitionRules` class. For example, in the `evaluate_search()` function, transition rules are established with `SearchCode` as the initial state, transitioning to `Finished` upon triggering specific events like `\"did_search\"` or `\"finish\"`.\\n   - The `global_params` and `state_params` dictionaries are used to configure the model and state-specific parameters, such as the number of search results or whether to provide initial context.\\n\\n2. **Instantiation of the `Evaluation` Class**:\\n   - After setting up the transition rules, an instance of the `Evaluation` class from Cluster 9 is created. This class is imported from `moatless.benchmark.evaluation`.\\n   - The constructor of the `Evaluation` class (`benchmark/evaluation.py`) requires several parameters, including directories for storing evaluation data, the name of the evaluation, and the transition rules defined previously. Additionally, parameters like `max_file_context_tokens` and `litellm_callback` are passed to control the evaluation process\\'s behavior.\\n\\n3. **Execution of the Evaluation**:\\n   - The `run_evaluation_with_moatless_dataset()` method of the `Evaluation` class is called, which manages the entire evaluation lifecycle. This involves processing instances, managing state transitions, and generating reports.\\n   - Inside the `Evaluation` class, methods such as `_evaluate_instance()` are critical. This method sets up the environment for each instance, initializes an `AgenticLoop`, and runs the loop to handle state transitions based on the defined rules.\\n\\n4. **State Management via `AgenticLoop`**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` class, part of Cluster 9, is pivotal in managing the state transitions during the evaluation. It uses the transition rules to navigate between different states like `SearchCode`, `IdentifyCode`, and `DecideRelevance`.\\n   - It initializes with parameters such as `max_cost`, `max_transitions`, and `instructor_mode`, which define the constraints and mode of operation for the loop.\\n   - The loop runs until a terminal state, such as `Finished` or `Rejected`, is reached, encapsulating the logic for handling actions and transitions.\\n\\n5. **Trajectory and Reporting**:\\n   - The `Trajectory` class in Cluster 9 records the sequence of state transitions and actions taken during the evaluation. It plays a critical role in persisting this information, which can be used for generating detailed reports.\\n   - The `generate_md_report()` function, also part of Cluster 9, utilizes the trajectory data to create markdown reports summarizing the evaluation\\'s results, including any errors encountered and the final code submissions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the transition from Cluster 10 to Cluster 9 involves initiating the evaluation process through function calls in `benchmark/claude_evaluation.py`, which then leverages the `Evaluation` and `AgenticLoop` classes in Cluster 9 to execute and manage the evaluation workflow, ultimately facilitating automated code search and identification with detailed reporting.', \"The transition between Cluster 9 and Cluster 97236 involves the integration of state management and execution flow within an automated code evaluation framework.

This method is responsible for setting up the necessary workspace and managing the trajectory of the evaluation.\\n\\n2. **Initialization of `AgenticLoop`**:\\n   - A key interaction occurs when `_evaluate_instance` initializes the `AgenticLoop` class from Cluster 97236. \\n   - The `AgenticLoop` is initialized with parameters such as `transition_rules`, `workspace`, `metadata`, and other configurations like `max_cost`, `max_transitions`, and `instructor_mode`. These parameters guide the loop's behavior and constraints during execution.\\n\\n3. **Handling of Trajectories**:\\n   - The `Trajectory` class is used within the evaluation process to keep track of the different states and transitions. The method checks for existing trajectory data and loads it if available, ensuring continuity in the evaluation.\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` interacts with this trajectory to save the current state and manage transitions.\\n\\n### Cluster 97236: Automated Code State Management and Transition System\\n\\n1. **State Management with `AgenticLoop`**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` class is central to Cluster 97236's contribution to the evaluation process. It manages the execution flow by running through states until a terminal state (either `Finished` or `Rejected`) is reached.\\n   - The loop employs methods like `run`, `_execute_state_until_transition`, and `_execute_state` to handle the evaluation's iterative process, ensuring that each state is executed and transitions are appropriately handled.\\n\\n2. **State Classes and Execution**:\\n   - Various state classes, such as `ClarifyCodeChange`, `EditCode`, and `PlanToCode`, are defined within Cluster 97236, each inheriting from `AgenticState`.\\n   - These states encapsulate specific logic related to their purpose, such as verifying line numbers in `ClarifyCodeChange` or editing code within a specified range in `EditCode`.\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` interacts with these state classes by executing actions and processing transitions based on the defined rules.\\n\\n3. **Transition Management**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` employs transition rules to determine the next state based on the current state's response. This is facilitated by the `TransitionRules` class, which manages the mapping from one state to another based on triggers and conditions.\\n   - The loop ensures that constraints such as maximum cost and retries are adhered to, and it logs transitions and state changes throughout the process.\\n\\n4. **Interaction with Workspace**:\\n   - The workspace, initialized and managed by the `Evaluation` class, is passed to the `AgenticLoop` and used by state classes to interact with the code repository. This ensures that code changes and context are accurately reflected and managed throughout the evaluation.\\n\\nIn summary, the transition from Cluster 9 to Cluster 97236 is characterized by the delegation of state management and execution control to the `AgenticLoop` class.

This transition is facilitated by the `AgenticLoop`, which uses the `TransitionRule` to determine the next state based on the trigger from the action response.\\n   - The `IdentifyCode` class in Cluster 77036 is tasked with processing the search results and identifying relevant code spans. It uses parameters like `ranked_spans` and `expand_context` to manage how search results are expanded and evaluated.\\n\\n4. **Decision Making and Context Expansion:**\\n   - The `DecideRelevance` state evaluates the relevance of identified code spans. It uses methods like `_execute_action` to determine if a transition to a finishing state should occur based on the relevance count.\\n   - Both `IdentifyCode` and `DecideRelevance` involve context expansion, allowing for additional context to be included in decision-making processes.\\n\\n### Interactions and Code Entities\\n\\n- **AgenticLoop:** Acts as the orchestrator for state transitions, utilizing transition rules to move from `SearchCode` to `IdentifyCode` and potentially to `DecideRelevance`.\\n- **TransitionRules:** Defines the conditions under which states transition, such as from `SearchCode` to `IdentifyCode`.\\n- **IdentifyCode and DecideRelevance:** These states in Cluster 77036 utilize search results to expand context and make decisions about code relevance, completing the transition process initiated in `SearchCode`.\\n\\nThis transition exemplifies a structured flow where an automated system identifies relevant code spans, verifies their relevance, and expands the context as needed, ensuring an efficient and systematic approach to code evaluation and management.\", 'The transition between Cluster 77036 and Cluster 13 involves the interaction between the `SearchCode` state in Cluster 77036 and the `CodeIndex` class in Cluster 13. This interaction is crucial for executing code searches within a larger automated code evaluation and workflow system.\\n\\n### Overview of Components\\n\\n**Cluster 77036 (Source):**\\n- **`SearchCode` (AgenticState):** This class is part of a state-based system where each state represents a stage in a workflow. `SearchCode` is responsible for initiating and managing code search operations based on defined parameters.\\n  - Attributes include `max_search_results`, `provide_initial_context`, and others that define the scope and behavior of the search process.\\n\\n**Cluster 13 (Destination):**\\n- **`CodeIndex`:** This class is responsible for executing search operations over a codebase. It includes methods such as `search()` and `semantic_search()` to find code snippets based on various criteria like query strings, class names, function names, and file patterns.\\n\\n### Transition Details\\n\\n1. **Initiation of Search:**\\n   - The `SearchCode` state is responsible for initiating a search operation. When the `SearchCode` state is active, it triggers a search by interacting with the `CodeIndex` class.\\n\\n2. **Interaction with `CodeIndex`:**\\n   - The `SearchCode` state calls the `search()` method of the `CodeIndex` class. This is a key method that orchestrates the search process based on the provided parameters.\\n   - The `search()` method in `CodeIndex` can handle queries based on class names, function names, or free-text queries. It determines whether to perform a name-based search using `find_by_name()` or a semantic search using `semantic_search()`.\\n\\n3. **Semantic Search Execution:**\\n   - If the search requires semantic understanding (e.g., based on a query or code snippet), the `semantic_search()` method is invoked.\\n   - This method constructs a search query, applies any necessary filters (like excluding test files), and calls `_vector_search()` to perform the actual search operation using vector embeddings.\\n\\n4. **Processing Search Results:**\\n   - Once the search is executed, `CodeIndex` processes the results, filtering and organizing them into `SearchCodeResponse` objects. These objects encapsulate the search results, including file paths and relevant code spans.\\n   - Results are organized into `SearchCodeHit` objects, which detail the specific file paths and code spans that matched the search criteria.\\n\\n5. **Transition Management:**\\n   - The search results from `CodeIndex` are returned to the `SearchCode` state, which then decides on the next action based on these results.\\n   - The state may transition to another state such as `IdentifyCode` if further processing of the identified code spans is required.\\n\\n### Interaction Flow\\n\\n- The `SearchCode` state configures the search parameters and delegates the execution to `CodeIndex`.\\n- `CodeIndex` performs the search and returns a structured response with relevant code snippets.\\n- The `SearchCode` state uses this response to make decisions about further processing or transitioning to a subsequent state.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThis transition illustrates a tightly-coupled interaction where a state within a workflow system relies on a dedicated search component to perform complex code retrieval tasks. The design allows the `SearchCode` state to remain focused on managing the workflow while delegating the intricacies of search operations to the `CodeIndex` class. This separation of concerns enhances modularity and reusability within the system.', 'The transition between Cluster 13 and Cluster 24 revolves around the process of performing a semantic search for relevant code snippets in a codebase using vector-based search techniques.\\n\\n### Cluster 13: Code Search and Retrieval System\\n\\n1. **`CodeIndex` Class**: This class is responsible for handling code search operations. It provides methods like `search()` and `semantic_search()` to perform different types of searches based on input parameters such as `query`, `code_snippet`, `class_names`, `function_names`, and `file_pattern`.\\n\\n2. **`semantic_search()` Method**: The `semantic_search()` function in `CodeIndex` is a high-level method that coordinates the search process. It constructs a search query by appending class and function names if provided, and applies file pattern filters.\\n\\n3. **Interaction with `_vector_search()`**: Within the `semantic_search()` method, after setting up filters and parameters, it delegates the actual search operation to the `_vector_search()` method by calling `self._vector_search(query, file_pattern=file_pattern, exact_content_match=code_snippet)`. This is where the transition to Cluster 24 occurs.\\n\\n### Cluster 24: Automated Code Vector Search and Filtering System\\n\\n1. **`_vector_search()` Method**: This function, part of the `CodeIndex` class, performs the core vector-based search. It generates query embeddings and constructs a `VectorStoreQuery` with specified filters, including category and file pattern.\\n\\n2. **Query Embedding and Filtering**: `_vector_search()` begins by embedding the search query using a model (`self._embed_model.get_query_embedding(query)`). It then applies filters to exclude specific files, such as test files, and checks for exact content matches if specified.\\n\\n3. **Retrieving and Processing Search Results**: The method queries the vector store (`self._vector_store.query(query_bundle)`) and processes the results by filtering out irrelevant snippets based on conditions like file inclusion/exclusion and query/content matches. Each relevant code snippet is encapsulated in a `CodeSnippet` object, which includes metadata such as file path, content, and tokens.\\n\\n4. **Returning Results**: The processed search results are returned as a list of `CodeSnippet` objects. The method logs the count of filtered and ignored snippets, as well as the number of total search results returned.\\n\\n### Interaction Summary\\n\\n- **Delegation of Task**: The `semantic_search()` method in Cluster 13 delegates the task of performing the actual vector-based search to the `_vector_search()` method in Cluster 24. This delegation is initiated by calling `_vector_search()` with the constructed query and relevant parameters.\\n\\n- **Data Flow**: The search parameters flow from `semantic_search()` to `_vector_search()`, where they are used to perform the vector search. The results from `_vector_search()` are then processed back in `semantic_search()` to construct a `SearchCodeResponse`, which is returned to the caller.\\n\\n- **Encapsulation of Results**: The results from `_vector_search()` are encapsulated as `CodeSnippet` objects, which are aggregated and returned as part of the `SearchCodeResponse` in the `semantic_search()` method.\\n\\nThrough this transition, the codebase efficiently separates the concerns of constructing a search query and performing the detailed vector search, leveraging the specialization of each cluster to handle distinct aspects of the search process.', 'The transition from Cluster 77036 to Cluster 97236 involves a sequence of state changes that are integral to the automated code evaluation and modification process. This transition is orchestrated by the `AgenticLoop` system, which manages the state transitions based on predefined rules and conditions.\\n\\n### Transition Overview\\n\\n1. **Initial State - Cluster 77036:**\\n   - The process begins in Cluster 77036 with the `SearchCode` state, part of the code context expansion and decision-making system. Here, a search operation is conducted to identify relevant code spans using parameters such as `max_search_results` and `initial_context_tokens`.\\n   \\n2. **Decision Making - DecideRelevance:**\\n   - After obtaining search results, the state transitions to `DecideRelevance`, where the relevance of the identified code spans is assessed. The `DecideRelevance` class, an extension of `AgenticState`, manages this process. It uses the `_execute_action` method to decide whether the task is complete based on the `finish_after_relevant_count` parameter and whether additional context is needed. This decision is influenced by the `_relevant_count` method, which tracks the number of relevant decisions made.\\n\\n3. **Transition to Cluster 97236:**\\n   - If the code is deemed relevant, the state may transition to `PlanToCode` or `EditCode` in Cluster 97236. This transition is facilitated by the `AgenticLoop` class\\'s `_execute_state` method, which handles state execution and transitions based on action responses. A response with a \"finish\" trigger will lead to a transition to a new state in Cluster 97236.\\n\\n4. **Destination State - Cluster 97236:**\\n   - Within Cluster 97236, the `PlanToCode` state involves planning code changes, potentially expanding the context further using `expand_context_with_related_spans`, and preparing a plan for code modification.\\n   - Alternatively, the state could transition to `EditCode`, where actual code changes are implemented. The `EditCode` class facilitates this by managing instructions for code changes, the file path, and specific lines to be updated within the code. Both `PlanToCode` and `EditCode` utilize fields such as `max_prompt_file_tokens` to manage the size of code context considered during operations.\\n\\n### Interaction and Code Entities\\n\\n- **State Transition Management:**\\n  - The `AgenticLoop` class plays a crucial role in executing state transitions. It determines the next state using the `_create_state` method, which constructs the new state based on transition rules and output data from the current state. This is crucial for moving from decision-making in Cluster 77036 to planning or editing in Cluster 97236.\\n\\n- **State Classes:**\\n  - Each state, such as `DecideRelevance`, `PlanToCode`, and `EditCode`, is a subclass of `AgenticState`, inheriting methods for handling actions and transitions.\\n  - The `ActionResponse` object returned by `_execute_action` in `DecideRelevance` determines the subsequent transition, indicating whether to proceed to code editing or remain in the decision-making phase.\\n\\n- **Parameter Configuration:**\\n  - Parameters such as `max_prompt_file_tokens` and `expand_context` are consistently used across states to control context size and expansion behavior, ensuring continuity and coherence in the transition process.\\n\\nIn summary, the transition from Cluster 77036 to Cluster 97236 involves a strategic progression from identifying relevant code to planning or executing changes, managed by a sophisticated state transition system. This process is underpinned by a series of methodical actions and decisions encapsulated within state classes and facilitated by the `AgenticLoop`.', 'The transition within Cluster 97236, from `PlanToCode` to `EditCode`, is a critical part of the automated code state management and transition system. This transition process involves several code entities and mechanisms that coordinate to refine code changes and prepare them for subsequent review or finalization.\\n\\n### Key Entities and Interaction:\\n\\n1. **PlanToCode State (edit/plan.py)**:\\n   - **Role**: This state is responsible for formulating a plan to implement code changes. It sets up the context needed for the code changes and handles any initial setup required before moving to the actual editing phase.\\n   - **Key Actions**: \\n     - Expands context with related spans to provide a comprehensive view of the code.\\n     - Initializes the file context, which is crucial for determining which parts of the code need to be modified.\\n\\n2. **EditCode State (edit/edit.py)**:\\n   - **Role**: This state executes the plan by applying the specified code changes. It verifies the changes and ensures they align with the instructions provided.\\n   - **Key Actions**:\\n     - Retrieves the specific lines of code that need to be modified, using the start and end lines specified.\\n     - Prepares the code context and ensures the changes are within the token limits.\\n     - Verifies the modifications to ensure they meet the intended purpose.\\n\\n3. **AgenticLoop (moatless/loop.py)**:\\n   - **Role**: Manages the overall flow of state transitions. It ensures that states transition smoothly from one to the next based on predefined rules and triggers.\\n   - **Key Methods**:\\n     - `_execute_state()`: Executes the current state, processes actions, and determines if a transition should occur.\\n     - `transition_to()`: Moves the workflow from one state to another, in this case from `PlanToCode` to `EditCode`.\\n\\n4. **Transition Mechanism**:\\n   - **Transition Rules**: Defined in the `TransitionRules` class, these rules specify the conditions under which transitions occur. For instance, a transition from `PlanToCode` to `EditCode` might be triggered once the code planning is complete and the necessary context is prepared.\\n   - **Triggers and Outputs**: During the execution of `PlanToCode`, upon successful completion of planning and context setup, a trigger initiates the transition to the `EditCode` state. The output from `PlanToCode` becomes the input for `EditCode`, ensuring continuity and data integrity.\\n\\n5. **Supporting Components**:\\n   - **FileContext**: Used to manage and provide access to the relevant code snippets and files. It ensures that `EditCode` has the necessary data to apply changes.\\n   - **Token Management**: The `count_tokens` function helps manage the size of code snippets to ensure they fit within the allowed token limit for processing, maintaining efficiency in code handling.\\n\\n### Interaction Flow:\\n\\n- The `AgenticLoop` orchestrates the transition by first executing the `PlanToCode` state where the context and plan for code changes are established.\\n- Upon meeting the transition criteria (as specified in the `TransitionRules`), the loop initiates a transition to the `EditCode` state.\\n- During this transition, data such as file paths, span IDs, and instructions are passed as parameters to `EditCode`, allowing it to pick up seamlessly from where `PlanToCode` left off.\\n- The `EditCode` state then uses this information to apply the changes, verify them, and prepare them for review or finalization.\\n\\nThis structured transition ensures a systematic and efficient workflow for managing code changes, leveraging the strengths of each state and ensuring a seamless flow of information and actions.', \"The transition from Cluster 97236 to Cluster 9 involves a seamless flow from executing state-based operations within an agentic loop to processing the results of those operations as part of an automated evaluation and reporting system.\\n\\n### Cluster 97236: State Management and Execution\\n1. **AgenticLoop Class**:\\n   - In Cluster 97236, the `AgenticLoop` class orchestrates the execution of different states (`AgenticState` subclasses such as `ClarifyCodeChange`, `EditCode`, `PlanToCode`, etc.) within a loop. This loop continuously processes actions and performs state transitions based on predefined transition rules (`TransitionRules`).\\n\\n2. **State Execution**:\\n   - Each state, such as `ClarifyCodeChange`, is designed to handle specific tasks, like verifying line numbers for code changes. These tasks are executed through methods like `_execute_action()`, which interact with the workspace and file context to perform code modifications or clarifications.\\n\\n3. **State Transitions**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` manages transitions between states using the `_execute_state_until_transition()` and `_execute_state()` methods. These methods determine the next state based on the current state's response to an action, using transition rules from `TransitionRules`.\\n\\n4. **Trajectory Management**:\\n   - The `AgenticLoop` maintains a `Trajectory` object that logs the sequence of states and transitions, capturing the workflow's progress and decisions. This trajectory is critical for tracking the evaluation process and is persisted for later analysis.\\n\\n### Cluster 9: Evaluation and Reporting\\n1. **Evaluation Class**:\\n   - Once the `AgenticLoop` completes its execution, control transitions to Cluster 9's `Evaluation` class. The `_evaluate_instance()` method of this class takes the trajectory produced by the `AgenticLoop` and processes it to compile the results of the evaluation.\\n\\n2. **Trajectory Processing**:\\n   - The `Evaluation` class loads the trajectory using `Trajectory.load()` if the evaluation was previously run and not finished. It uses this trajectory to extract information about the evaluation progress, actions taken, and final results.\\n\\n3. **Result Compilation**:\\n   - Using the gathered information, the `Evaluation` class generates detailed reports by invoking methods like `generate_md_report()`. This method creates a markdown report that includes problem statements, predictions, and any errors encountered, along with the sequence of state transitions and actions.\\n\\n4. **Metadata and Cost Tracking**:\\n   - The `Evaluation` class utilizes utility functions such as `trace_metadata()` to generate session metadata and `get_total_cost()` to calculate the total cost of the evaluation based on the trajectory's trace ID. This information is integral for performance analysis and optimization.\\n\\n5. **Report Generation and Submission**:\\n   - The processed results, including diffs from code changes, are saved in structured reports and submitted as part of the evaluation. The `generate_md_report()` method formats these results into a human-readable form, making it easier to review the automated evaluation's outcomes.\\n\\n### Interaction between Clusters\\n- The transition from Cluster 97236 to Cluster 9 is marked by the handoff of the trajectory object from the `AgenticLoop` to the `Evaluation` class.\\n- The `AgenticLoop` ensures that the trajectory is comprehensive, capturing all state transitions and actions, which the `Evaluation` class then uses to generate detailed reports and track evaluation metrics.\\n- This workflow highlights a robust system where state-based code evaluations are not only executed but also meticulously documented, making it suitable for automated testing and continuous integration pipelines.\"]\n",

For example, the `evaluate_search()` function sets up transitions specifically for search-related tasks, utilizing the `TransitionRules` class to establish the initial state as `SearchCode` and define possible state transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Creation of Evaluation Instances**: Each evaluation function instantiates the `Evaluation` class from Cluster 9 (`benchmark/evaluation.py`). This is done by providing parameters such as `transitions`, `evaluation_name`, `index_store_dir`, and others. These parameters are crucial as they dictate how the evaluation will be conducted. The `transitions` parameter, in particular, links Cluster 10 with Cluster 9 by passing the previously defined `TransitionRules` to the `Evaluation` instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Global and State Parameters**: The functions in Cluster 10 also define `global_params` and `state_params`. These parameters customize the behavior of the evaluation process, impacting aspects like model configurations and specific state settings (e.g., `max_tokens`, `provide_initial_context`). These parameters are then passed to the `Evaluation` constructor, influencing how the evaluation logic unfolds in Cluster 9.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **`_evaluate_instance` Method**: Within the `Evaluation` class, the `_evaluate_instance()` method is pivotal. It manages the lifecycle of a single evaluation instance, creating a `Trajectory` object that records the evaluation's progress and results.

      "\n",
      "3. **State Management with `AgenticLoop`**: The `AgenticLoop` class orchestrates the state transitions during the evaluation. It uses the parameters and rules specified in the `TransitionRules` to determine the flow of states. The loop continues to execute until a terminal state (`Finished` or `Rejected`) is reached, or an exception occurs.\n",
